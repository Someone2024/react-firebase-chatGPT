# React Firebase Chat

This repository is a fork of the original repository [react-firebase-chat](https://github.com/fireship-io/react-firebase-chat) created by [fireship-io](https://github.com/fireship-io). The key feature added to this fork is the integration of OpenAI's Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT for real-time communication.

## Key Features

The main feature added to this fork is the integration of ChatGPT into the chat room. The following outlines the key features:

1. **Private Chat Room**: Upon accessing the application, the user is directed to a private chat room where they can interact solely with ChatGPT. Other users are not able to see or participate in this chat room.

2. **Real-time Communication**: The chat room updates in real-time, providing a seamless and interactive experience with ChatGPT. As the user sends messages, they receive immediate responses from the language model.

3. **OpenAI's ChatGPT**: ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, serves as the conversational partner in the private chat room. It utilizes the advanced language model to generate responses based on the user's input.
